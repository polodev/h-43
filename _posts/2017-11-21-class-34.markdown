### using illuminate/database eloquent in our model    
Model name always will be singular form and first letter of model will be uppercase. Its kind of convention. Table name will plural and all lowercase     
In our case table name is `cities` and Model name is `City`. Which extends Eloquent Model     
In our case table name is `people` and Model name is `Person`. Which extends Eloquent Model     

~~~php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
class Person extends Model {
  protected $table = 'people';
  protected $guared = [];
}
~~~

### using relationship

If we think about plain English `people` belogs to `city` and `city` has many `people`. So in city table we will add column `person_id`
* City has many people
* people belongs to city     

So city model   

~~~php
public function people () {
    return $this->hasMany(Person::class);
  }
~~~

So in Person model     

~~~php
public function city() {
  return $this->belongsTo(City::class);
}
~~~

### clean url or pretty url in php
clean routing in php is very easy. But it make your website url pretty and it's SEO friendly     


<hr>



Inside `index.php`

~~~php
$purl =  parse_url( $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], PHP_URL_PATH);
$path = trim($purl, '/');
if (array_key_exists($path, $routes))  {
  require $routes[$path];
}else {
  require 'views/notfound.view.php';
}
~~~


Routes array will be look like following     

~~~php
$routes = [
  '' => 'controllers/index.controller.php',
  'about' => 'controllers/about.controller.php',
  'contact' => 'controllers/contact.controller.php',
];
~~~
